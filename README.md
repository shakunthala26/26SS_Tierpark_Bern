# Introduction

This document describes the Case allocation process at Changekultur organization as part of the “Digitilaization of Businesss Processes” project at the University of applied Sciences and Arts North-Western Switzerland. The purpose of this process is to reduce manual effort, improve transparency, and support better decision-making during coach allocation. 

# Description of the Use Case 


In the digital age, manual and informal allocation processes can become time-consuming, inconsistent, and difficult to monitor. For our project, we are inspired by  ChangeKultur GmbH, a Zürich‑based social services organization, that provides family coaching, youth support, and integration programs across Switzerland. The company focuses on empowering families through structured coaching and multilingual support. 

One of the processes that required attention was the case allocation process. When a new client case is received, the organisation needs to identify and assign the most suitable Family Coach within a short period of time. In the current situation, this decision is largely manual and depends on the Case Coach’s personal knowledge of available coaches. This makes the process time-intensive and increases the risk of subjective decisions, incomplete information, and delays. 

Our digital solution aims to streamline and automate the case allocation process. Our solution uses Camunda to model and control the workflow and Make to support automation and system integration. This improves transparency, reduces manual effort, and ensures that the allocation decision is supported by structured data while still keeping human judgement in the final decision. This is important because family coach allocation should not only be based on system scores, but also on professional judgement and the specific needs of the family. 

There is no automation in the current ChangeKultur case allocation process. Therefore, our group created a AS-IS BPMN process based on the information available, identified the main pain points, and designed a TO-BE process that introduces automation, scoring, review steps, and error handling for a more reliable and transparent case allocation process.

(The TO-BE process describes an automated case allocation process for assigning a suitable Family Coach to a new case. The purpose of this process is to reduce manual effort, improve transparency, and support better decision-making during coach allocation.
This to-be process combines automation, data-based scoring, and human review. This is important because coach allocation should not depend solely on technical matching criteria, such as distance or workload, but also on human judgement, soft factors, and the client's specific needs.)

1. Manual case handling 
The responsible person must manually collect and compare all information needed for the assignment. 

2. Time-consuming coach selection 
Finding a suitable family coach can take time, especially if several coaches need to be checked. 

3. Limited transparency 
It is difficult to clearly track why a specific coach was selected or rejected. 

4. No automated distance calculation 
Distance or travel time between the client and possible family coaches is not automatically calculated. 

5. No structured scoring  
There is no way to identify a suitable coach for a given case. Suitability decisions depend on personal judgment.

## 1. Description 


The To-Be process represents a significant step towards a more digitalized and automated **Case Allocation** process. The goal of the project team was to automate time-consuming, frequently occurring and rule-based tasks that directly address the main pain points of the company. The collected pain points and the visualized As-Is process formed the foundation for designing the To-Be process.

The use case focuses on allocating a client case to the most suitable Family Coach. The process begins when the admin enters the client data through a structured form. This information is stored in the `unassigned_cases` table in the database. After the client data has been submitted, the system automatically calculates distance and scoring information for potential Family Coaches. The calculation is based on hard factors such as workload, language requirements, location and coach profile information.

The calculated results are stored in the `assignments` table for each individual case-coach combination. The Admin then reviews the generated assignments before the process moves to the Case Coach. Once an assignment is available, the Case Coach evaluates additional soft factors, such as case complexity, coach experience and coach type. After this evaluation, the Case Coach reviews the Family Coach profile and decides whether the recommended coach is appropriate.

If an error occurs during the automated calculation or assignment generation, the process is routed to a manual step. In this exception path, the Case Coach reviews the error and manually selects an alternative coach. For this manually selected coach, the soft factors are evaluated again before the process continues.

If the coach is recommended and accepted, the client is informed about the allocation and the case is marked as assigned. If the coach is not recommended, the process returns to the soft factor evaluation step so that another assignment can be reviewed.

Compared to the As-Is process, the To-Be process contains fewer manual tasks and introduces several automated system tasks. This improves efficiency, reduces manual coordination effort and creates a more structured and transparent basis for decision-making. At the same time, human judgement remains part of the process, especially when reviewing assignment suggestions and evaluating soft factors.

---

## 2. Criteria for Task Automation

Before designing the To-Be process, the project team evaluated which tasks were suitable for automation. The goal was not to automate the entire process blindly, but to identify tasks where automation creates real business value.

The following criteria were used to assess the automation potential of process tasks:

| Criterion | Evaluation Question | Automation Potential |
|---|---|---|
| Standardization | Is the degree of standardization high enough? Are the inputs and outputs fixed? | High, if the task follows a stable and repeatable structure. |
| Rule-based Logic | Is the process rule-based, or does it require human judgement? | High, if clear business rules can be defined. |
| Digital Input | Are the required inputs available in a readable digital format? | High, if data is already structured and digitally available. |
| Volume and Manual Effort | How time-consuming is the process? How high is the transaction volume? | High, if the task is repetitive and manually intensive. |
| Dependencies and Limitations | Are there dependencies or technical limitations that prevent automation? | Low, if many external dependencies or unclear data structures exist. |
| Risk | Which process risks require manual work or human validation? | Low, if incorrect automation could create significant operational risks. |
| Probability of Upgrades | Will the underlying system be maintained or replaced shortly? | Low, if the system landscape is unstable or temporary. |

The Case Allocation process was considered suitable for automation because several activities are repetitive, data-driven, rule-based and based on structured input data.


## 3. Process Overview

The To-Be process is called **Case Allocation**. It starts when new client data is entered and continues with the automated calculation of potential coach assignments.

The first four main tasks are:

| Step | Task | Type | Purpose |
|---:|---|---|---|
| 1 | Enter client data (Forms) | User Task | Capture the client and case information |
| 2 | Calculate Distances and Score | Service Task | Calculate distance, duration and suitability score for possible coach assignments |
| 3 | Extract assignments | Service Task | Retrieve calculated assignment suggestions and return them to Camunda |
| 4 | Review assignments | User Task | Allow a human user to review the proposed assignments |

---

## 4. Overview involved systems: Make, Camunda, Google Form, Google Sheet, Flask API

<img width="1807" height="1114" alt="To-Be Process Export drawio" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1cc6fe29-a093-4bb6-8b89-07cfbbf6a0b5" />


The high-level architecture shows how the To-Be Case Allocation process is supported by different technical components and automation tools.

The process starts with the submission of client data through a Google Form. The data is stored in the `unassigned_cases` table and then processed through Make scenarios. Make acts as the central integration layer between Google Sheets, Camunda, Google Maps, the Flask API and the Python scoring logic.

The Flask API provides access to the Python scoring script, which calculates the suitability score for each case-coach combination. The Google Maps API is used to calculate travel distance and driving duration. The results are stored in the `assignments` table.

Camunda coordinates the overall workflow. It triggers Make scenarios, manages user tasks such as claiming, completing and reviewing tasks, and supports the final decision-making process. The Camunda Cockpit is used to monitor and manage the process execution.

## 5. Main Changes in the To-Be Process

### 5.1 Creation of a New Database Structure

A new database structure was created using Google Sheets. The database consists of three main tables:

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `unassigned_cases` | Stores newly entered client cases that still need to be allocated. |
| `coaches` | Stores all relevant coach information, including languages, skills and capacity. |
| `assignments` | Stores calculated case-coach combinations, including distance, duration, eligibility and scoring results. |

This structure allows the process to store and process all relevant information in a structured way.

Additional data fields were introduced so that the company has more information available for automated decision support. These fields include languages, case type, workload, coach skills, coach capacity, case complexity and travel duration.

---

### 5.2 Structured Data Collection Through an Onboarding Form

An onboarding form was created to ensure that new case data is collected in a consistent and structured format.

The form helps to standardize the input data and reduces the risk of missing or inconsistent information. Once submitted, the data is stored in the `unassigned_cases` table and can be used by the automated workflow.

This is important because automation requires readable and structured digital input. Without standardized input data, the later calculation of distances, eligibility and scores would not be reliable.

---

### 5.3 Integration of the Google Maps API

The Google Maps API is used to automatically calculate the travel distance and estimated driving duration between the client address and the coach address.

The calculated values are stored in the `assignments` table.

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `distance_text` | Human-readable distance, for example `49.6 km`. |
| `distance_value` | Distance in meters. |
| `duration_text` | Human-readable driving duration, for example `45 mins`. |
| `duration_value` | Driving duration in seconds. |

This automation replaces manual distance checks and ensures that every possible case-coach combination is evaluated consistently.

---

### 5.4 Flask API and Python Scoring Script

A Flask API was created to make the Python scoring logic accessible from Make.

The Flask API exposes the following endpoint:

```http
POST /score-assignment
```

Make sends one case-coach combination to this endpoint. The Python script then calculates the eligibility and score for the assignment.

The scoring logic considers the following criteria:

| Scoring Area | Description |
|---|---|
| Language Match | Checks whether the client and coach have compatible languages. |
| Capacity | Checks whether the coach has enough remaining capacity. |
| Travel Duration | Checks whether the travel duration is acceptable. |
| Skill Match | Checks whether the coach has the required skills for the case type. |

The result is returned to Make and written back into the `assignments` table.

## 6. Data Model

### Entity Relationship Diagramm / ERD
<img width="801" height="1031" alt="Datenmodel DigiBP drawio" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65f22ec8-8f28-44b2-bc57-9a1939c744f2" />

Since the prototype uses Google Sheets as a lightweight database, some case and coach attributes are stored redundantly in the `assignments` table. In a fully normalized relational database, these attributes would normally be retrieved through the foreign keys `case_id` and `coach_id`. However, for the Google Sheets and Make-based prototype, storing these values as snapshot data makes the assignment results easier to review, export and process in subsequent automation steps.

### 6.1 Table: `unassigned_cases`

## 7. Detailed Process Description

### Step 1: Enter Client Data Forms

The process starts with a user task where the administration enters the client and case data into a Google Form `Onboarding Details` [Link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScMQjz-gnmlCsyXJdbgRhEz9PHKRcYQhKztVMIKHRDN2gxzEA/viewform). This includes personal data, address data, languages, urgency, case type, workload and case complexity.

The entered data can then be submitted and the data is directly stored in the `unassigned_cases` Google Sheet from the Google-Doc `Data Base Client`



#### Related Make Scenario: Get Onboarding Data

The Make scenario **Get Onboarding Data** reads new cases from `unassigned_cases`.
<img width="748" height="294" alt="Make Get Onboarding Data" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe4a38e4-f045-4015-9769-6225a276fe75" />


The scenario filters for rows where `camunda_submitted` is still empty. It then sends the case information to the Camunda `submit-form` endpoint for the process `CaseAllocation66`.

The JSON sent to Camunda includes variables such as:

```json
{
  "caseId": "...",
  "firstName": "...",
  "lastName": "...",
  "address": "...",
  "city": "...",
  "postalCode": "...",
  "mainLanguage": "...",
  "otherLanguage": "...",
  "urgency": "...",
  "caseType": "...",
  "workload": "...",
  "case_complexity": "..."
}
```

After successful submission, the case is marked as submitted in Google Sheets by setting:

```text
camunda_submitted = TRUE
```

---

### Step 2: Calculate Distances and Score

The task **Calculate Distances and Score** is an automated service task.

Its purpose is to generate possible coach assignments for an unassigned case. For each available coach, the process calculates the travel distance and travel duration from the coach address to the client address. Afterwards, the system evaluates whether the coach is suitable for the case.

The output of this step is a set of assignment rows in the `assignments` table.

#### Related Make Scenario: Calculate Distances and Score

<img width="1490" height="287" alt="Make Calculate Distances and Score" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e5ec88b-8255-4ca7-a6df-89692cff43d2" />


This scenario is triggered by a Make webhook from Camunda. It performs the following logic:
![alt text](image-1.png)

1. Receive trigger from Camunda.
2. Search for unassigned cases in `unassigned_cases`.
3. Mark the case in the `unassigned_cases`in the field `assigned` = `TRUE` 
4. Read available coaches from the `coaches` table.
5. Calculate distance and duration with Google Maps.
6. Add one row per case-coach combination to the `assignments` table.
7. Call the Flask API endpoint `/score-assignment`.
8. Write the returned scoring result back to the assignment row.
9. Return a response to Camunda.

#### Google Maps Calculation

For each coach, Google Maps calculates:

| Output | Description |
|---|---|
| `distance.text` | Human-readable distance, for example `49.6 km` |
| `distance.value` | Distance in meters |
| `duration.text` | Human-readable duration, for example `45 mins` |
| `duration.value` | Duration in seconds |
| `status` | Google Maps result status |

These values are stored in the `assignments` table.

#### Assignment Row Creation

The scenario creates one assignment row per case-coach combination.

The `Add a Row` module writes values such as:

```text
assignment_id = case_id + "-" + coach_id
case_id
coach_id
coach_first_name
coach_last_name
coach_main_languages
coach_other_languages
coach_skills
coach_remaining_capacity
coach_city
case_first_name
case_last_name
case_size_in_procent
case_urgency
case_main_languages
case_other_languages
case_type
case_city
distance_text
distance_value
duration_text
duration_value
status
created_at
coach_experience
case_complexity
coach_type
```

#### Flask API Scoring

After the assignment row has been created, Make calls the Flask API:

```http
POST /score-assignment
Content-Type: application/json
```

Example payload:

```json
{
  "assignment_id": "CASE-0002-COACH001",
  "case_id": "CASE-0002",
  "coach_id": "COACH001",
  "case_main_language": "German",
  "case_other_language": "French",
  "coach_main_language": "German",
  "coach_other_language": "French",
  "case_type": "Medium",
  "coach_skills": "Kinderbetreuung,Familienbegleitung",
  "case_size_in_percent": 20,
  "coach_remaining_capacity": 80,
  "duration_value": 2703
}
```

Example response:

```json
{
  "assignment_id": "CASE-0002-COACH001",
  "case_id": "CASE-0002",
  "coach_id": "COACH001",
  "eligible": true,
  "exclusion_reason": "",
  "language_score": 30,
  "duration_score": 25,
  "skill_score": 0,
  "total_score": 55
}
```

The returned values are written back into the score columns of the same assignment row.

---
## Step 3: Review Error 

The task **Review error** is a User Task. 

It is triggered when the automated allocation step fails, for example because of: 

missing or inconsistent data,  

an API or integration problem (Google Maps API failure, Google Sheets access or data issue, Make scenario execution failure, HTTP/API request errors) 

or an unsuccessful system calculation.  

At this stage, the responsible person reviews the problem and identifies why the automated allocation could not be completed successfully. The person then decides how to proceed so that the case can continue in the process. 

The purpose of this step is to make sure that technical or data-related problems are not ignored. A human user can understand the issue and decide how to continue the case allocation process. 

## Step 4: Assign Manually 

The task **Assign Manually** is a Manual Task. 

If the automated allocation cannot be completed, the responsible person manually selects another possible Family Coach using available information and professional judgement. 

This is a fallback step. It ensures that the case allocation process can continue even if the automated service task fails. 

The purpose of this step is to provide a fallback path for exceptional situations. It ensures that the process remains operational even when the automated matching step fails. 

## Step 5: Extract Assignments

The task **Extract assignments** retrieves the calculated assignment suggestions from the `assignments` table and sends them back to Camunda.

This step is necessary because the calculated assignments are stored externally in Google Sheets. Camunda therefore needs a service step to fetch the prepared assignment data before a human user can review it.

#### Related Make Scenario: Extract Assignments

<img width="1526" height="438" alt="Make Extract assignments" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d57e33c6-a02b-4b39-9bc7-bd2aa3e2a394" />


The Make scenario **Extract Assignments** is triggered by a webhook.

The scenario searches the `assignments` table for rows where:

```text
status = OK
```

After finding an assignment row, Make sends the relevant assignment fields back to Camunda through the Camunda `submit-form` endpoint.

The returned variables include for example:

```text
case_id
assignment_id
coach_first_name
coach_last_name
exclusion_reason
language_score
duration_score
skill_score
total_score
coach_skills
case_first_name
case_last_name
case_size_in_procent
case_main_languages
case_other_languages
case_type
distance_text
duration_text
eligible
```

After the data has been returned to Camunda, the assignment row can be marked as processed.

---

## Step 6: Review Assignments

The task **Review assignments** is a user task.

At this stage, the system has already calculated possible coach assignments. The human user can now review the suggested coach, the case data, the travel distance, duration, eligibility and scores.

The purpose of this step is not to fully automate the final decision. Instead, the automatic scoring provides decision support. A human user can still apply professional judgement before continuing with the final allocation.


## Step 7: Evaluate soft factors 

The task **Evaluate soft factors** is a Business Rule Task. 

At this stage, the system evaluates qualitative suitability criteria that are not fully covered by the previous hard-factor calculation. While the earlier automated step focuses on measurable criteria such as distance, language compatibility, and scoring, this step considers more contextual and qualitative aspects of the coach-case match. The soft factors include case complexity, coach experience, and coach type. 

This task is implemented in Camunda using DMN-based decision logic. The DMN table receives the relevant input values and returns a recommendation outcome indicating whether the proposed Family Coach is suitable for the client case. 

The purpose of this step is to provide structured and transparent decision support for more qualitative criteria. It improves consistency in the evaluation process while still leaving the final judgment to the responsible Case Coach.

## Step 8: Review Family Coach Profile 

The task **Review Family Coach profile** is modeled as a User Task. 

At this stage, the Case Coach reviews the proposed Family Coach in greater detail. This review includes the coach profile, the automated recommendation, and the result of the soft-factor evaluation. 

The Case Coach assesses whether the proposed coach is appropriate for the specific client case. This may include reviewing the coach’s professional experience, employment type, practical suitability for the case, and whether the match is sensible in the real operational context. 

The purpose of this step is to ensure that the final allocation decision is not made solely by the system. Instead, the recommendation is validated by a human expert, which preserves professional judgment and reflects the actual practice of coach allocation in the organisation.

## Step 9: Recommended? 

The element **Recommended?** is an Exclusive Gateway. 

At this point, the process checks whether the Reviewed Family Coach is recommended for the client case. 

If the coach is suitable, the process continues to the next step, where the client is informed about the allocation. If the coach is not suitable, the process loops back to Evaluate soft factors, so that another coach option can be assessed. 

The purpose of this gateway is to create a clear decision point in the process. It ensures that only suitable coach recommendations move forward to final communication with the client. 

<img width="512" height="542" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7d572a88-fdce-4d85-9097-439ead3458ec" />

## Step 10: Inform Client 

The task **Inform client** is a User Task. 

At this stage, the client is informed about the allocation result, depending on the communication channel used by the organisation. 

The responsible person informs the client that a Family Coach has been selected and communicates the relevant assignment outcome. 

The purpose of this step is to ensure that the client receives clear confirmation about the allocation before the process ends. 

## Step 11: Case Assigned 

The event **Case assigned** is an End Event. 

At this stage, the process is completed because the client case has been successfully allocated to a suitable Family Coach and the client has been informed. 

The purpose of this event is to mark the successful completion of the TO-BE case allocation process.

## 8. Scoring Logic

The Python scoring script evaluates each possible case-coach combination. The goal of the scoring logic is to identify whether a coach is eligible for a case and, if eligible, how suitable the coach is based on predefined business rules.

The scoring model consists of two parts:

1. **Hard Criteria**  
   These criteria must be fulfilled. If one hard criterion is violated, the coach is not eligible and the total score is set to `0`.

2. **Weighted Score Components**  
   If all hard criteria are fulfilled, the system calculates a score based on language match, travel duration and skill match.

---

### 8.1 Hard Criteria

A coach is not eligible if at least one hard criterion is violated.

| No. | Criterion | Rule | Data Type | Description | Consequence |
|---:|---|---|---|---|---|
| H1 | Language Match | `case_main_language != coach_main_language` AND `case_main_language != coach_other_language` AND `case_other_language != coach_main_language` | String comparison | There is no sufficient language overlap between case and coach. | `eligible = false`, `total_score = 0` |
| H2 | Capacity | `coach_remaining_capacity * 1.2 < case_size_in_percent` | Numeric | The coach does not have enough remaining capacity, including a safety factor of 20%. | `eligible = false`, `total_score = 0` |
| H3 | Travel Duration | `duration_value > 10800` | Integer | The travel duration is longer than 3 hours. | `eligible = false`, `total_score = 0` |

If a hard criterion is violated, the scoring result is:

```text
eligible = false
total_score = 0
exclusion_reason = reason for exclusion
```

Example:

```json
{
  "eligible": false,
  "exclusion_reason": "No valid language match",
  "language_score": 0,
  "duration_score": 0,
  "skill_score": 0,
  "total_score": 0
}
```

---

### 8.2 Scoring Model

If all hard criteria are fulfilled, the total score is calculated based on three score components.

| Score Component | Maximum Points | Description |
|---|---:|---|
| Language Score | 30 | Evaluates the language fit between case and coach. |
| Duration Score | 30 | Evaluates the travel duration between coach and client. |
| Skill Score | 40 | Evaluates whether the coach has the required skill for the case type. |
| Total Score | 100 | Sum of all score components. |

The total score is calculated as follows:

```text
total_score = language_score + duration_score + skill_score
```

---

### 8.3 Language Score

The language score evaluates whether the case languages match the coach languages. A main language match receives the highest score. Matches involving secondary languages receive fewer points.

| No. | Rule | Points | Data Type | Meaning |
|---:|---|---:|---|---|
| L1 | `case_main_language = coach_main_language` | 30 | String | Perfect main language match |
| L2 | `case_main_language = coach_other_language` | 15 | String | Case main language matches coach secondary language |
| L3 | `case_other_language = coach_main_language` | 15 | String | Case secondary language matches coach main language |
| L4 | No language match | 0 | String | No language score |

If multiple language rules match, the highest applicable score is used.

Example:

```text
case_main_language = German
coach_main_language = German

language_score = 30
```

---

### 8.4 Duration Score

The duration score evaluates the travel duration between the coach address and the client address. The value `duration_value` is provided by the Google Maps API in seconds.

| No. | Rule | Points | Data Type |
|---:|---|---:|---|
| D1 | `0 < duration_value <= 1800` | 30 | Integer |
| D2 | `1800 < duration_value <= 3600` | 25 | Integer |
| D3 | `3600 < duration_value <= 5400` | 20 | Integer |
| D4 | `5400 < duration_value <= 7200` | 15 | Integer |
| D5 | `7200 < duration_value <= 9000` | 10 | Integer |
| D6 | `9000 < duration_value <= 10800` | 5 | Integer |
| D7 | `duration_value > 10800` | 0 | Integer, but handled as hard criterion |

The shorter the travel duration, the higher the duration score.

Example:

```text
duration_value = 2703

duration_score = 25
```

---

### 8.5 Skill Score

The skill score evaluates whether the case type matches the skills of the coach.

| No. | Rule | Points | Data Type | Meaning |
|---:|---|---:|---|---|
| S1 | `case_type = coach_skills` OR `case_type in coach_skills` | 40 | String | Coach has the required skill for the case |
| S2 | No skill match | 0 | String | Coach does not have the required skill |

The skill comparison supports cases where the coach has multiple skills stored in one field.

Example:

```text
case_type = Kinderbetreuung
coach_skills = Kinderbetreuung, Familienbegleitung

skill_score = 40
```

---

### 8.6 Example Calculation

Example input:

```json
{
  "assignment_id": "CASE-0002-COACH001",
  "case_id": "CASE-0002",
  "coach_id": "COACH001",
  "case_main_language": "German",
  "case_other_language": "French",
  "coach_main_language": "German",
  "coach_other_language": "French",
  "case_type": "Kinderbetreuung",
  "coach_skills": "Kinderbetreuung,Familienbegleitung",
  "case_size_in_percent": 20,
  "coach_remaining_capacity": 80,
  "duration_value": 2703
}
```

Calculation:

```text
Language Score:
case_main_language = coach_main_language
German = German
=> 30 points

Duration Score:
duration_value = 2703
1800 < 2703 <= 3600
=> 25 points

Skill Score:
case_type is included in coach_skills
Kinderbetreuung is included in Kinderbetreuung,Familienbegleitung
=> 40 points

Total Score:
30 + 25 + 40 = 95
```

Example output:

```json
{
  "assignment_id": "CASE-0002-COACH001",
  "case_id": "CASE-0002",
  "coach_id": "COACH001",
  "eligible": true,
  "exclusion_reason": "",
  "language_score": 30,
  "duration_score": 25,
  "skill_score": 40,
  "total_score": 95
}
```

---

### 8.7 Summary of the Scoring Logic

The scoring model ensures that unsuitable coaches are excluded before a score is calculated. This is done through hard criteria for language match, capacity and travel duration.

Only if all hard criteria are fulfilled, the system calculates a weighted score. The total score supports the decision-making process by making coach suitability transparent and comparable.

The final decision is still made by a human user in the review step. The scoring model provides decision support, but it does not fully replace professional judgement.

5. Check that scores are written to `assignments`.
6. Trigger `Extract Assignments`.
7. Check that assignment variables arrive in Camunda.

---

## 13. Resulting Benefits

The To-Be process provides several improvements compared to the As-Is process.

| Benefit | Description |
|---|---|
| Less manual effort | Repetitive tasks such as distance checks and scoring are automated. |
| Higher transparency | Assignment decisions are based on visible criteria and scores. |
| Better data quality | Structured forms and database tables reduce inconsistent input. |
| Faster processing | Possible coach assignments are calculated automatically. |
| More objective decision support | Each case-coach combination is evaluated using the same scoring logic. |
| Human control remains | Final review is still performed by a person before the allocation is completed. |

---

## 14. Known Limitations

This implementation is a prototype and uses Google Sheets as a lightweight database. For a production-ready solution, a relational database should be considered.

The Flask API is currently hosted through a development environment. For stable productive usage, the API should be deployed on a permanent hosting service.

The scoring model is rule-based. Future versions could include more sophisticated ranking logic, weighting configuration or manual override rules.

---


## 15. Summary

The To-Be Case Allocation process combines structured data collection, automated distance calculation, rule-based scoring and human review.

The process does not fully replace human decision-making. Instead, it supports the responsible person by providing transparent and pre-calculated assignment suggestions.

This approach ensures that automation is applied where it creates value, while human judgement remains part of the final allocation decision.

# Conclusion

The TO-BE BPMN Camunda model improves the Case allocation process by combining automation with human decision-making. Automated service tasks reduce manual effort by calculating distance, scoring coaches, and extracting assignment suggestions. User tasks ensure that important decisions, such as reviewing assignments and family coach profiles, remain controlled by responsible staff.

The model also includes a clear error handling path, which makes the process more robust when technical problems or missing data occur. The recommendation loop allows the responsible person to reject unsuitable coaches and evaluate alternatives.

Overall, this TO-BE process supports faster, more transparent, and more reliable case allocation. It is suitable for further implementation in Camunda and can be integrated with tools such as Make, Google Sheets, Google Maps, and email services.
